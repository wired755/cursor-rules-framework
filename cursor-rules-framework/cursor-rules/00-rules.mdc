# Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL MANDATORY OPERATIONAL RULES

🚨 **MANDATORY PERMISSION GATE**: Before ANY file modification, you MUST:

1. **STOP** - Do not touch any files
2. **ANALYZE** - Understand the requirement  
3. **EXPLAIN** - Describe your proposed solution
4. **WAIT** - Ask for explicit permission
5. **CONFIRM** - Only proceed after user types "APPROVE"

**ENFORCEMENT**: You CANNOT use file modification tools until:
- You have stated the exact tool and action
- You have received explicit "APPROVE" from user
- **PERMISSION EXPIRES**: Each new request requires fresh permission
- **NO CARRYOVER**: Previous permissions do not apply to new actions

## STANDARD APPROVAL PHRASE
**MANDATORY**: The ONLY valid approval phrase is: **"APPROVE"**
- User must type exactly: "APPROVE" (case-insensitive acceptable)
- No variations accepted (not "yes", "ok", "proceed", etc.)
