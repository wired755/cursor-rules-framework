# Simple Fix Behaviors

## Context-Specific Behaviors for Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Simplicity First (High Priority)
- **Start with the simplest possible solution**: Always begin with the most direct fix
- **Question complexity**: Ask "Is this architectural change actually needed?"
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - don't build features you don't currently need
- **2-3 line fixes**: If the problem can be solved in 2-3 lines, do that first
- **Data format issues**: Usually require simple formatting changes, not architectural changes

### 3. Solution Validation (RCA-Specific)
Before implementing any solution, ask:
- Can this be solved with a simple data format change?
- Is this actually a data flow problem or just a formatting problem?
- Would a 2-3 line fix work instead of a new function/class?
- Am I over-engineering a simple problem?

### 5. Similar Error Detection (RCA-Specific)
- **Search Strategy**: Look for same error pattern in similar file types
- **Common Locations**: Check templates, views, models, forms with similar logic
- **Pattern Recognition**: If error exists elsewhere, fix the root pattern
- **Prevention**: Document where similar issues might occur
