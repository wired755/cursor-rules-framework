# Plan Behaviors

## Context-Specific Behaviors for Planning and Implementation

### 1. Simplicity First (Planning-Specific)
- **Start with the most basic implementation**: Begin with core functionality
- **Add complexity incrementally**: Build features in logical order
- **Question if each feature is actually needed**: Focus on essential requirements first
- **Plan for iteration**: Design for incremental delivery
- **Avoid over-planning**: Don't plan too far ahead

### 2. Incremental Approach (Planning-Specific)
- **Build in small, testable increments**: Each phase should be independently verifiable
- **Avoid big-bang implementations**: Break work into manageable chunks
- **Plan for parallel work**: Identify tasks that can be done simultaneously
- **Set clear milestones**: Define deliverables for each phase
- **Plan for feedback**: Include review and adjustment points

### 3. Realistic Estimation (Planning-Specific)
- **Include buffer time**: Account for unexpected issues and learning curve
- **Consider dependencies**: Factor in waiting time for external resources
- **Account for testing**: Include time for testing and debugging
- **Plan for iteration**: Allow time for refinement and improvement
- **Be conservative**: Under-promise and over-deliver

### 4. Risk Management (Planning-Specific)
- **Identify potential risks**: What could go wrong?
- **Plan mitigation strategies**: How to handle problems when they arise
- **Consider dependencies**: What external factors could affect the plan?
- **Plan for contingencies**: Alternative approaches if primary plan fails
- **Document assumptions**: Record what the plan depends on

### 5. Clear Dependencies (Planning-Specific)
- **Identify prerequisites**: What must be completed before each phase
- **Avoid circular dependencies**: Ensure logical sequence
- **Plan for parallel work**: Identify tasks that can be done simultaneously
- **Consider external dependencies**: Third-party services, team availability
- **Plan for handoffs**: Clear transition points between phases

## Planning Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Planning (Planning-Specific)
- Planning too far ahead without feedback
- Creating overly detailed plans that become obsolete
- Not allowing for flexibility and change
- Planning for hypothetical scenarios

### Under-Planning (Planning-Specific)
- Not identifying dependencies
- Not considering risks
- Unrealistic time estimates
- Not planning for testing and validation

## Planning Principles

### 1. Analysis Phase
- **Review Requirements**: Understand what needs to be accomplished
- **Identify Constraints**: Technical, time, resource limitations
- **Break Down Tasks**: Divide into manageable phases
- **Estimate Effort**: Realistic time and complexity estimates

### 2. Planning Phase
- **Create Phases**: Logical sequence of implementation steps
- **Define Dependencies**: What must be completed before each phase
- **Set Milestones**: Clear deliverables for each phase
- **Identify Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

### 3. Documentation Phase
- **Structure Plan**: Clear, actionable steps
- **Include Examples**: Concrete implementation details
- **Add Validation**: How to verify each phase completion
- **Create Timeline**: Realistic schedule with buffer time

### 4. Validation and Review
- **Check Completeness**: Ensure all requirements are covered
- **Verify Dependencies**: Confirm logical sequence
- **Review Risks**: Identify potential problems
- **Get Feedback**: Validate plan with stakeholders

## Planning When in Doubt
1. **Start with the simplest plan** that meets requirements
2. **Break work into small chunks** for easier management
3. **Plan for iteration** and feedback
4. **Identify risks early** and plan mitigation
5. **Be realistic** about time and resources
6. **Ask for clarification** on unclear requirements
7. **Plan for testing** and validation at each phase
