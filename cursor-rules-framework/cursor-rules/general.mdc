# General Cursor Rules


### 4. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Did I start with the simplest solution?
- [ ] Am I adding complexity that isn't needed?
- [ ] Could this be solved with a few lines instead of new functions?
- [ ] Am I following patterns just for the sake of following patterns?

## COMMON PROBLEM PATTERNS

### Data Format Issues
- **Symptoms**: Validation errors, "not one of the available choices"
- **Root Cause**: Data sent in wrong format (comma-separated vs individual values)
- **Solution**: Simple data formatting change (2-3 lines)
- **Example**: `fields: selectedFields.join(',')` → proper individual field values

### UI Issues
- **Symptoms**: Missing data, incorrect display
- **Root Cause**: Template context issues, not backend problems
- **Solution**: Check templates first, add context if needed
- **Example**: Missing template variables vs backend logic issues

### Validation Errors
- **Symptoms**: Form validation failures
- **Root Cause**: Usually data format or field mapping
- **Solution**: Check data format before modifying validation logic
- **Example**: Field choices mismatch vs validation rule problems


### 3. Template Debugging Protocol
- **Template inspection**: Always check what data is available in template context
- **Context verification**: Verify template variables exist before proposing backend changes
- **Simple solutions first**: Try context additions before complex backend modifications


## PRE-SOLUTION VALIDATION QUESTIONS
Before ANY code changes, ask yourself:
- [ ] Did I start with the simplest solution?
- [ ] Am I adding complexity that isn't needed?
- [ ] Could this be solved with a few lines instead of new functions?
- [ ] Am I following patterns just for the sake of following patterns?
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Did I ask for permission before making changes?**

## EMERGENCY STOP CHECKLIST
If you're about to make code changes:
- [ ] User explicitly said "Yes, implement this"
- [ ] I explained the solution first
- [ ] I waited for confirmation
- [ ] I'm not over-engineering

## MANDATORY RESPONSE TEMPLATE
When user requests changes:

### ANALYSIS
[Root cause analysis here]

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
[Step-by-step solution here]

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. [Specific change 1]
2. [Specific change 2]
3. [Specific change 3]

### CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
**I will NOT make any changes until you explicitly type "APPROVE".**

To proceed, you must type exactly: **"APPROVE"** (not "yes", "ok", or other phrases)

Do you want me to proceed with this implementation?

## IF YOU VIOLATED THE RULES
If you made changes without permission:
1. IMMEDIATELY stop and apologize
2. Explain what you should have done instead
3. Ask if user wants you to revert the changes
4. Commit to following the protocol going forward
