# Design Mode

## @design.mdc + Design Mode
**Objective**: Create architectural designs and solutions
**Trigger**: When user requests design creation or architecture analysis

## 🚨 MANDATORY GATE VERIFICATION 🚨

Before proceeding with design workflow:
- [ ] Loaded and verified rules.mdc
- [ ] Completed pre-action audit
- [ ] Permission state: [NONE|REQUESTED|GRANTED]
- [ ] Understanding: Only "APPROVE" is valid confirmation
- [ ] Session boundary: This is a NEW request requiring fresh permission
- [ ] Design Mode Active: NO implementation allowed in this mode

**ENFORCEMENT**: Design mode is for planning only - no code changes.

## Context Files
- `@rules.mdc` - Universal operational rules (always loaded automatically)
- `@designing.mdc` - Design behaviors (load with: @designing.mdc)
- `@project.mdc` - Project-specific context (optional, load with: @project.mdc)

## DESIGN WORKFLOW
### 1. Load Context
- Load mode-specific behaviors: `@designing.mdc`
- Load project context if needed: `@project.mdc`

### 2. Requirements Analysis
- **Understand Problem**: What exactly needs to be solved
- **Identify Constraints**: Technical or business requirements constraints
- **Examine Patterns**: Project patterns and relevant project files
- **Define Success Criteria**: How will we know it's working
- **Consider Alternatives**: Multiple approaches to evaluate

**GATE CHECKPOINT 1**: Requirements analyzed - Continue to architecture design (no permission required).

### 3. Architecture Design
- **Choose Approach**: Select the most appropriate solution
- **Define Components**: Key parts and their responsibilities
- **Plan Interactions**: How components work together
- **Consider Scalability**: Future growth and changes

**GATE CHECKPOINT 2**: Architecture designed - Continue to implementation strategy (no permission required).

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- **Break Down Work**: Specific implementation steps
- **Identify Dependencies**: What needs to be built first
- **Plan Testing**: How to verify the design works
- **Document Decisions**: Why this approach was chosen

**GATE CHECKPOINT 3**: Design complete - PERMISSION REQUIRED before implementation.
**Permission State**: Transition to REQUESTED.

## RESPONSE TEMPLATE

### DESIGN ANALYSIS
[Analysis of requirements and constraints]

### ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH
[High-level design decisions and rationale]

### COMPONENT DESIGN
[Key components and their responsibilities]

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
[How to build the design]

### TESTING APPROACH
[How to verify the design works]

### DESIGN VALIDATION
- [ ] `rules.mdc` was read before any action, and critical rules and behaviors followed.
- [ ] Meets all requirements
- [ ] Addresses constraints
- [ ] Follows best practices and design principles
- [ ] Is implementable
- [ ] Is testable

### IMPLEMENTATION READY

**PERMISSION STATE**: REQUESTED

🚨 **CRITICAL: I will NOT implement until you type "APPROVE"** 🚨

To proceed with implementation, you must type exactly: **"APPROVE"**

- **DESIGN MODE COMPLETE**: This approval confirms design only
- **IMPLEMENTATION SEPARATE**: Implementation requires separate explicit permission
- **STANDARD PHRASE**: Only "APPROVE" is accepted
- NO code changes without explicit "APPROVE"
- NO file modifications without "APPROVE"
- NO implementation until you type "APPROVE"
- WAIT for your explicit "APPROVE" command
