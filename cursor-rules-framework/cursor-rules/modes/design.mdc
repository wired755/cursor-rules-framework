# Design Mode

## @design.mdc + Design Mode
**Objective**: Create architectural designs and solutions
**Trigger**: When user requests design creation or architecture analysis

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE 🚨
- Your first action MUST read and obey all critical rules in `rules.mdc`.

## Context Files
- `@rules.mdc` - Universal operational rules (always loaded automatically)
- `@designing.mdc` - Design behaviors (load with: @designing.mdc)
- `@project.mdc` - Project-specific context (optional, load with: @project.mdc)

## DESIGN WORKFLOW
### 1. Load Context
- Load mode-specific behaviors: `@designing.mdc`
- Load project context if needed: `@project.mdc`

### 2. Requirements Analysis
- **Understand Problem**: What exactly needs to be solved
- **Identify Constraints**: Technical or business requirements constraints
- **Examine Patterns**: Project patterns and relevant project files
- **Define Success Criteria**: How will we know it's working
- **Consider Alternatives**: Multiple approaches to evaluate

### 3. Architecture Design
- **Choose Approach**: Select the most appropriate solution
- **Define Components**: Key parts and their responsibilities
- **Plan Interactions**: How components work together
- **Consider Scalability**: Future growth and changes

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- **Break Down Work**: Specific implementation steps
- **Identify Dependencies**: What needs to be built first
- **Plan Testing**: How to verify the design works
- **Document Decisions**: Why this approach was chosen

## RESPONSE TEMPLATE

### DESIGN ANALYSIS
[Analysis of requirements and constraints]

### ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH
[High-level design decisions and rationale]

### COMPONENT DESIGN
[Key components and their responsibilities]

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
[How to build the design]

### TESTING APPROACH
[How to verify the design works]

### DESIGN VALIDATION
- [ ] `rules.mdc` was read before any action, and critical rules and behaviors followed.
- [ ] Meets all requirements
- [ ] Addresses constraints
- [ ] Follows best practices and design principles
- [ ] Is implementable
- [ ] Is testable

### IMPLEMENTATION READY
🚨 **CRITICAL: I will NOT implement until you say "Begin Implementation"** 🚨
- NO code changes without explicit permission
- NO file modifications without confirmation
- NO implementation until you approve
- WAIT for your explicit "Begin Implementation" command
