# Debugging Mode

## DEBUG PROTOCOL
### 0. 🚨**MANDATORY GATE VERIFICATION**🚨: You cannot proceed until this verification is complete.
- [ ] Loaded and verified `@00-rules.mdc`
- [ ] Understanding: Only "APPROVE" is valid confirmation
- [ ] Response boundary: Each response is a NEW request requiring fresh permission
**ENFORCEMENT**: Cannot proceed with workflow until this verification is complete.

### 1. **UNDERSTAND**: Understand the problem through error messages, logs, reproduction steps, frequency, and environment (local, dev, staging, production)
- Debugging Behaviors: `@31-debugging.mdc`

### 2. **BASELINE**: Verify the expected behavior

### 3. **CLASSIFY**: Understand if problem is Environment, Configuration, Code Logic, Data/Schema, UI, Network, or other

### 4. **CONTEXTUALIZE**: Gather contextual information from understanding, baseline, and classification.
- Project Context (if needed optional): `@project.mdc`
- Project Stack Context (if needed): `\stack\`
- Read project files.
- Read previous issues log
- Question user
- Identify recent changes

### 5. **DIAGNOSE**: Form hypothesis; higher-complexity issues have more hypothesis Identify problem root cause(s).

### 6. **GATE CHECKPOINT 1**: Diagnostics complete. Respond to user. **ENFORCEMENT**: Explicit permission required from user for any verification steps.

#### MANDATORY DIAGNOSTICS RESPONSE STRUCTURE
You must complete all sections.

##### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (mandatory)
[Brief description of expected behavior]

##### ERROR SUMMARY (mandatory)
[Brief description of error and context]

##### HYPOTHESIS (mandatory)
[Brief descriptions of hypotheses]

##### VERIFICATION STEPS (mandatory)
[Brief descriptions of steps proposed to verify hypothesis]

##### DEBUG STEPS VALIDATION CHECKLIST  (mandatory)
- [ ] Read debugging `@31-debugging.mdc`
- [ ] Understood the error.
- [ ] Understood baseline behavior.
- [ ] Classified the problem.
- [ ] Contextualized and diagnosed the problem
- [ ] **RESPONSE BOUNDARY**: Verified this is a new request requiring fresh permission
- [ ] **NO CARRYOVER**: Did not assume permission from previous requests

🚨 **CRITICAL: I will NOT make changes until you type "APPROVE"** 🚨

To proceed with implementation, you must type exactly: **"APPROVE"**

### 7. **VERIFY**: Perform methodical steps to confirm/refute direct evidence.

### 8. **ROOT CAUSE**: Identify true root cause, tracing chain back to single event causing the issue.

### 9. **IDENTIFY FIX**: Propose simple fix for root cause.
- Context: `@34-fix.mdc`

### 10. **ASSESS IMPACT**: Assess impact of fix, and identify 

### 11. **GATE CHECKPOINT 2**: Root cause and fix identified. Respond to user. **ENFORCEMENT**: Explicit permission required from user to proceed.

#### MANDATORY ROOT CAUSE RESPONSE STRUCTURE
You must complete all sections.

##### ROOT CAUSE (mandatory)
[Brief root cause description]

##### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (mandatory)
[Detailed analysis of the underlying cause, including why its a root cause and not a symptom]

##### VERIFICATION (mandatory)
[Description of the verification steps]

##### PROPOSED FIX (mandatory)
[Simple, direct solution with implementation steps, including file-by-file changes with code examples]

##### IMPACT ANALYSIS (mandatory)
[Description of impact of change, including side effects and similar unresolved issues in solution.]

##### DEBUG STEPS VALIDATION CHECKLIST (mandatory)
- [ ] Verified the problem
- [ ] Identified root cause
- [ ] Read `@34-fix.mdc` and identified the fix
- [ ] Assessed impact of change
- [ ] Identified similar problems in code
- [ ] **RESPONSE BOUNDARY**: Verified this is a new request requiring fresh permission
- [ ] **NO CARRYOVER**: Did not assume permission from previous requests

🚨 **CRITICAL: I will NOT make changes until you type "APPROVE"** 🚨

### 12. **IMPLEMENT FIX**: Implement fix above

#### MANDATORY FIX RESPONSE STRUCTURE
You must complete all sections.

##### FIX CONFIRMATION (mandatory)
[Brief description of steps implemented]

##### VALIDATION CHECKLIST (mandatory)
- [ ] Implemented all parts of fix
