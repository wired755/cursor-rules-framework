# Plan Mode

## @plan.mdc + Plan Mode
**Objective**: Create structured implementation plans
**Trigger**: When user requests planning or analysis

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE 🚨
**NEVER MAKE CODE CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
- STOP before making any changes
- ANALYZE and explain the plan first
- WAIT for explicit user permission
- ONLY proceed after user approves the plan

## Context Files
- `@rules.mdc` - Universal operational rules (always loaded automatically)
- `@planning.mdc` - Planning behaviors (load with: @planning.mdc)
- `@project.mdc` - Project-specific context (optional, load with: @project.mdc)

## PLAN WORKFLOW

### 1. Load Context
- Load mode-specific behaviors: `@planning.mdc`
- Load project context if needed: `@project.mdc`

### 2. Analysis Phase
- **Review Requirements**: Understand what needs to be accomplished
- **Identify Constraints**: Technical, time, resource limitations
- **Break Down Tasks**: Divide into manageable phases
- **Estimate Effort**: Realistic time and complexity estimates

### 3. Planning Phase
- **Create Phases**: Logical sequence of implementation steps
- **Define Dependencies**: What must be completed before each phase
- **Set Milestones**: Clear deliverables for each phase
- **Identify Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

### 4. Documentation Phase
- **Structure Plan**: Clear, actionable steps
- **Include Examples**: Concrete implementation details
- **Add Validation**: How to verify each phase completion
- **Create Timeline**: Realistic schedule with buffer time

## RESPONSE TEMPLATE

### PLAN ANALYSIS
[Analysis of requirements and constraints]

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
[Structured plan with phases and steps]

### PHASE BREAKDOWN
**Phase 1: [Name]**
- Objectives: [What this phase accomplishes]
- Tasks: [Specific actionable items]
- Dependencies: [What must be completed first]
- Timeline: [Estimated duration]

**Phase 2: [Name]**
- Objectives: [What this phase accomplishes]
- Tasks: [Specific actionable items]
- Dependencies: [What must be completed first]
- Timeline: [Estimated duration]

### RISK ASSESSMENT
[Potential risks and mitigation strategies]

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

### PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED
🚨 **CRITICAL: I will NOT proceed until you approve this plan** 🚨
- NO code changes without explicit permission
- NO file modifications without confirmation
- NO implementation until you approve
- WAIT for your explicit plan approval
