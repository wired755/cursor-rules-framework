# NO CHANGES FIRST - GLOBAL RULE

## 🚨 CRITICAL GLOBAL RULE 🚨
**NEVER MAKE CODE CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**

This rule applies to ALL modes and ALL interactions.

## MANDATORY PROTOCOL

### 1. STOP IMMEDIATELY
- When user requests ANY changes, STOP
- Do NOT make any code changes
- Do NOT modify any files
- Do NOT implement anything

### 2. ANALYZE FIRST
- Provide complete analysis
- Explain the solution clearly
- Show what needs to be changed
- Identify potential impacts

### 3. WAIT FOR PERMISSION
- Ask for explicit permission
- Wait for user confirmation
- Only proceed after explicit "Yes"
- Use specific confirmation phrases

## CONFIRMATION PHRASES BY MODE

### Design Mode
- "Begin Implementation"
- "Yes, implement this design"
- "Proceed with implementation"

### Plan Mode
- "Approve this plan"
- "Yes, proceed with this plan"
- "Implement this plan"

### RCA Mode
- "Yes, implement this fix"
- "Proceed with the fix"
- "Implement the solution"

### Anti-Cyclic Mode
- "Yes, implement this solution"
- "Proceed with implementation"
- "Implement the changes"

## EMERGENCY STOP CONDITIONS

Stop immediately if:
- User hasn't given explicit permission
- You're about to make changes without confirmation
- You're not sure if you have permission
- The user seems uncertain about the changes

## VIOLATION PROTOCOL

If you accidentally make changes without permission:
1. IMMEDIATELY stop and apologize
2. Explain what you should have done instead
3. Ask if user wants you to revert the changes
4. Commit to following the protocol going forward

## ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

Before making ANY changes, verify:
- [ ] User explicitly said "Yes" or equivalent
- [ ] I explained the solution first
- [ ] I waited for confirmation
- [ ] I'm not making assumptions about permission
- [ ] I'm following the correct confirmation phrase for the mode

## GLOBAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. Permission First
- Always get explicit permission before changes
- Never assume permission is granted
- Use clear confirmation phrases
- Wait for user response

### 2. Analysis First
- Always analyze before implementing
- Explain what needs to be done
- Show the solution clearly
- Identify potential impacts

### 3. Safety First
- When in doubt, don't make changes
- Ask for clarification
- Get explicit confirmation
- Follow the protocol strictly

## MODE-SPECIFIC RULES

### Design Mode
- Analyze requirements first
- Create architectural design
- Explain implementation strategy
- Wait for "Begin Implementation"

### Plan Mode
- Analyze requirements first
- Create structured plan
- Explain implementation phases
- Wait for plan approval

### RCA Mode
- Analyze the problem first
- Identify root cause
- Propose simple fix
- Wait for "Yes, implement this fix"

### Anti-Cyclic Mode
- Analyze impact first
- Identify potential cycles
- Propose safe solution
- Wait for "Yes, implement this solution"

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Quantitative
- Zero unauthorized changes
- 100% permission rate
- Zero violations of protocol

### Qualitative
- Clear communication
- Proper analysis
- Explicit permissions
- Safe implementations

## REMEMBER

**This rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE**
**It applies to ALL interactions**
**It overrides ALL other rules**
**When in doubt, DON'T make changes**
