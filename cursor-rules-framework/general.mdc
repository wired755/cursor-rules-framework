# General Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL OPERATIONAL RULES
🚨 **CRITICAL RULE** 🚨
**NEVER MAKE CODE CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
🚨 **CRITICAL RULE** 🚨

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
When user requests ANY changes:
1. STOP - Do not make any code changes
2. ANALYZE - Provide root cause analysis
3. EXPLAIN - Describe the solution
4. WAIT - Ask for explicit permission
5. CONFIRM - Only proceed after user says "Yes"

## PROBLEM-SOLVING GUIDELINES

### 1. Simplicity First Principle
- **Start with the simplest possible solution**: Always begin with the most direct fix
- **Question complexity**: Ask "Is this architectural change actually needed?"
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - don't build features you don't currently need
- **2-3 line fixes**: If the problem can be solved in 2-3 lines, do that first
- **Data format issues**: Usually require simple formatting changes, not architectural changes

### 2. Problem Classification
- **Data Format Issues**: Usually require simple formatting changes, not architectural changes
- **Validation Errors**: Often just data format or field mapping issues
- **UI Issues**: Check templates and context before modifying backend
- **Performance Issues**: Only optimize after identifying actual bottlenecks

### 3. Solution Validation
Before implementing any solution, ask:
- Can this be solved with a simple data format change?
- Is this actually a data flow problem or just a formatting problem?
- Would a 2-3 line fix work instead of a new function/class?
- Am I over-engineering a simple problem?

### 4. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Did I start with the simplest solution?
- [ ] Am I adding complexity that isn't needed?
- [ ] Could this be solved with a few lines instead of new functions?
- [ ] Am I following patterns just for the sake of following patterns?

## COMMON PROBLEM PATTERNS

### Data Format Issues
- **Symptoms**: Validation errors, "not one of the available choices"
- **Root Cause**: Data sent in wrong format (comma-separated vs individual values)
- **Solution**: Simple data formatting change (2-3 lines)
- **Example**: `fields: selectedFields.join(',')` → proper individual field values

### UI Issues
- **Symptoms**: Missing data, incorrect display
- **Root Cause**: Template context issues, not backend problems
- **Solution**: Check templates first, add context if needed
- **Example**: Missing template variables vs backend logic issues

### Validation Errors
- **Symptoms**: Form validation failures
- **Root Cause**: Usually data format or field mapping
- **Solution**: Check data format before modifying validation logic
- **Example**: Field choices mismatch vs validation rule problems

## DEVELOPMENT RULES

### 1. No Unprompted Changes
- **Explicit user requests only**: Never make code changes without explicit user instruction
- **Explain before implementing**: Always describe what needs to be done before making changes
- **Wait for confirmation**: Only proceed with changes when specifically asked
- **Start simple**: Always propose the simplest solution first

### 2. Data Flow Understanding
- **Check templates first**: When debugging UI issues, always examine templates before backend
- **Trace data flow**: Follow data from context through template to display
- **Use print statements**: Add debugging output to understand actual data flow
- **Don't assume**: Verify how things actually work rather than making assumptions
- **Format issues first**: Check data format before assuming logic problems

### 3. Template Debugging Protocol
- **Template inspection**: Always check what data is available in template context
- **Context verification**: Verify template variables exist before proposing backend changes
- **Simple solutions first**: Try context additions before complex backend modifications

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Over-Engineering
- Creating new functions for simple data formatting
- Adding architectural layers for 2-3 line fixes
- Following patterns without questioning if they're needed
- Building "future-proof" solutions for current problems

### Assumption-Based Solutions
- Assuming data flow problems without checking format
- Assuming backend issues without checking templates
- Assuming architectural problems without checking simple fixes
- Assuming complexity is needed without trying simple solutions first

## PRE-SOLUTION VALIDATION QUESTIONS
Before ANY code changes, ask yourself:
- [ ] Did I start with the simplest solution?
- [ ] Am I adding complexity that isn't needed?
- [ ] Could this be solved with a few lines instead of new functions?
- [ ] Am I following patterns just for the sake of following patterns?
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Did I ask for permission before making changes?**

## EMERGENCY STOP CHECKLIST
If you're about to make code changes:
- [ ] User explicitly said "Yes, implement this"
- [ ] I explained the solution first
- [ ] I waited for confirmation
- [ ] I'm not over-engineering

## MANDATORY RESPONSE TEMPLATE
When user requests changes:

### ANALYSIS
[Root cause analysis here]

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
[Step-by-step solution here]

### IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. [Specific change 1]
2. [Specific change 2]
3. [Specific change 3]

### CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
**I will NOT make any changes until you explicitly say "Yes, implement this solution."**

Do you want me to proceed with this implementation?

## IF YOU VIOLATED THE RULES
If you made changes without permission:
1. IMMEDIATELY stop and apologize
2. Explain what you should have done instead
3. Ask if user wants you to revert the changes
4. Commit to following the protocol going forward

## WHEN IN DOUBT
1. **Start with the simplest solution** - 2-3 lines before architectural changes
2. **Follow existing patterns** rather than creating new ones
3. **Check the context.md** file for specific requirements  
4. **Look at similar implementations** in the codebase
5. **Apply best practices** within project architectural constraints
6. **Ask for clarification** rather than making assumptions
7. **Test thoroughly** before considering changes complete
8. **Question whether you're over-engineering** - if the fix is simple, keep it simple

## DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW RULES

### Universal Documentation Standards
- **Be concise**: Write clearly and to the point without unnecessary words
- **Obey document section intent**: Only add content relevant to the current section (e.g., don't add business requirements to technical specifications)
- **Eliminate duplication**: Do not repeat information across documents; reference existing content instead
- **Group related content**: Organize similar content together within sections (e.g., group all technical specifications for a single feature)
- **Preserve existing details**: When updating documents, maintain existing accurate information unless it's incorrect
- **Replace only when incorrect**: Only replace details when they are factually wrong or outdated
- **Remove incorrect information**: Delete any factually incorrect or outdated details
- **Follow template structure**: Ensure content matches the document template's intended level of detail and organization

### Documentation Update Protocol
1. **Review existing content**: Check current document for accuracy and completeness
2. **Identify required changes**: Determine what needs to be added, updated, or removed
3. **Group related content**: Organize similar information together within appropriate sections
4. **Verify section relevance**: Ensure all content is appropriate for the document section
5. **Check for duplication**: Verify no information is repeated across documents
6. **Apply template structure**: Follow the document template's organization and detail level
7. **Maintain consistency**: Ensure all changes align with existing document standards
